## 10/17/2025 - Designed whole Schematic + PCB  

# Backstory
I started off by gathering ideas from my real life experiences. One of my key ideas was to make a model rocket flight controller. I recently joined my schools aerospace and rocketry club and have always been interested in data science and plotting to graphs. So I came up with an idea to log data from the flight that the rocket will go on. Eventually I ended up realizing I forgot to journal! oh no! *Please excuse the lack of Journals!* As i continue growing alongside this project there will be a lot more journals!



## What I did
I started off by gathering a list of parts I would need. On my whiteboard the Flight controller needed these key things

These eventually got changed and will be explained in the next section. But for now once I had a rough idea of what I wanted I started to scour the internet for parts I needed an came of with these parts.
* A RFM95W-915S2 for the Radio.
* A MAX-M10M-00B for the GPS
* A STM32F405RGTx as the microprocessor
* *For Sensors it uses*
* ADXL343
* MLX90395xLW
* MS563702BA03-50
* A LT1962EMS8 for power regulation
* A DM3D-SF for SD card logging.

## Not all goes to plan.
I worked trough many schematics to get to where I've gotten. Originally I wanted 3 Servos to control how the rocket positions itself in the air but I set myself a limitation of trying to make my PCB as small as I can. I was unable to learn what parts make up a Boost and Buck converter as I struggled to watch videos through it. Here is an earlier design of my Schematic ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjU3NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a1a541a8e03aad70e8caa65992c664d086b86d8a/image.png)

As you can see there are 3 1x3 connectors which were supposed to be used but I couldn't figure out voltages. I also managed to cutdown on the amount of pins I was using because I wasn't merging my MOSIs and MISOs alongside that my PCB was horribly wired. A lot of the edges were at 90 degrees which was a learning experience because I thought you could wire PCBS in anyway. It could lead to impedance

## Where am I now?

Currently I am finished (for now) It's 12:25am est and I think I could refine my work down the line with my next iteration. I think eventually i'll get to servo controls but that's a problem for me in the future to deal with.
I think this will be the checklist for next iteration
* Servos
* Improving spacing and wiring
* Recovery system
